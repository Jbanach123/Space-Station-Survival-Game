# Space-Station-Survival-Game
## Overview
Space Station Survival is a turn-based strategy game where you manage critical resources on a space station while surviving cosmic disasters. Built using Factory Method design pattern for event generation, the game challenges players to balance energy, oxygen, water, and food supplies while upgrading systems and responding to dynamically-created space emergencies.

## Key Features
### Resource Managment:
Four critical resources: Energy, Oxygen, Water, Food

Interconnected systems: Production chains require resource inputs

Maintenance costs: Modules consume resources during operation

Scarce supplies: Tough choices between upgrades and reserves
### Station Modules:
Power Module: Generates energy (consumes water)

Life Support: Produces oxygen (consumes energy)

Habitation: Creates water and food (consumes oxygen)

Research: Provides random bonuses

Defense: Protects against cosmic events
### Cosmic Disasters:
Progressive difficulty: Events intensify with each turnProgression System
Resource investment: Convert materials into experience points

Level advancement: Unlock improved production and efficiency

Module specialization: Unique upgrade paths for each system

Strategic choices: Prioritize critical systems for development



Varied threats: Solar storms, meteor showers, radiation leaks

Defense mechanics: Protect your station with upgraded systems

Cascading failures: Damaged modules create new vulnerabilities
### Progression System:
Resource investment: Convert materials into experience points

Level advancement: Unlock improved production and efficiency

Module specialization: Unique upgrade paths for each system

Strategic choices: Prioritize critical systems for development

## How to Play
### Core Gameplay Loop:
Review status: Check resources and module conditions

Make decisions: Upgrade, repair, or save resources

Advance turn: Progress to next cycle

Survive events: Respond to random cosmic disasters

Repeat: Balance short-term survival with long-term development

### Loss Conditions
Critical resource depletion (any type)

Complete destruction of all modules
